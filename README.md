Java Steam API

How to use: 

StoreFactory.getSteamStore(String cookies)

Where cookies are cookies taken from a logged in browser. Working on the logging in part so you can save-restore your session. 

Development of this API is in conjuncture with a closed source app. The main goal of this API is to be as fast as possible. I'd love to extend the listing item with a method to buy it instantly, but this would make the retrieval slower (most likely not a lot though), while I may only want to buy 1 in 100.
